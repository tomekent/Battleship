Battleship
==========

Battleship in Python. Implementing Dynamic Programming


A one sided game of battleships.

Take shots at an opponents randomly generated grid of ships.

Instructions
===========
Take shots by entering row and column numbers.

There are 5 types of ships:
* Destroyer: length 2
* Submarine: length 3
* Cruiser: length 3
* Battleship: length 4
* Carrier: length 5

Output will indicate one of three things:
* Miss
* Hit
  * Just a hit
  * Sunk a particular ship

Aim is to sink all 5 ships in as few moves as possible. 


Dynamic Programming Approach
============================

Can you write a dynamic program to optimally play the game? 

Write a set of controls that automatically choose which coordinate to aim for.
